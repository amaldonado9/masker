# masker / mask·er  
### *a thing that masks or conceals something else.*

**\-from the Oxford English Dictionary, (as of) 2024**

To put it simply, masker conceals the webpage you want to view in a sneaky way, unless you take a look at the code. 
Other than that, it seems flawless... right? Okay.

**Well, what exactly does it do anyway?**

* On the surface, it looks like a plain old calculator, but there's quite a bit more happening behind the scenes than you think\!  
    
* masker comes with a preset code \[000000\] that you can customize by entering the code then an asterisk ( \* ).  
    
* Entering the code by itself triggers a prompt that turns (almost—after all, *about:blank*s aren't perfect, y’know?) any website into an *about:blank* page. So if a friend wants a link to the page you're viewing, too bad for them\!  
    
* It's also worth noting that *about:blank*s may bypass web filters that restrict access at places like school or work. However, I can probably guarantee that about 99% of the pages you try will not successfully bypass them.  This project is not intended for that, it’s mostly for show and for fun. However, things can change in the future.


AND THAT’S IT\! I am terrible at making READMEs, so don’t expect much from me. Goodbye for now, and enjoy\!  
(P.S., you can download masker for local use by clicking “Code” at the top of the page and then clicking “Download ZIP”, or you can try it out now right [here](https://amaldonado9.github.io/masker))
